## Smart Contract Project

This project contains a Solidity smart contract that demonstrates the usage of `require()`, `assert()`, and `revert()` statements. Additionally, it includes instructions on how to set up the project and a brief overview of its functionality.

## Functionality

The smart contract included in this project implements the following functionality:

- Token transfer mechanism with basic validation using `require()` statements.
- An example of using the `assert()` statement.
- An example of causing a revert using the `revert()` statement.

## Getting Started

To deploy and interact with the smart contract, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Compile the smart contract using your preferred Solidity compiler.
4. Deploy the compiled contract to a compatible blockchain network.
5. Interact with the deployed contract using a blockchain interface like Remix or a custom frontend application.
